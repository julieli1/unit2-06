      Honestly, I don't know what to write anymore. 
      I don't like sports. Everytime I want to have 
      something interesting to talk about my brain just 
      shuts down and I don't remember anything. 
    </pre>
    <h3> Here's a list of things I like </h3>
    <div class="liste">
      <dl id="teehee">
        <dt> those milk flavouring straws </dt>
          <dd> only the chocolate ones though </dd>
        <dt> going on walks right after it rains </dt>
          <dd> the rain pushed down all the dust in the air and so the air smells so clean, my sinuses  are cleared </dd>
        <dt> honey lemon tea </dt>
          <dd> my mom makes this and it's so amazing. Maybe I'll make my next assignement about my mom's honey lemon tea. Finally, an idea! </dd>
        <dt> jolly ranchers hard candy </dt>
          <dd> it's actually been a long time since I've had jolly ranchers but it's my favourite candy. Unfortunately, ever since I got braces, I couldn't eat them, but it's not like I could gorge myself before. </dd>
        <dt> persimmons </dt>
          <dd> persimmons are amazing and you can't tell me otherwise. </dd>
